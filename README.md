This repository showcases a set of 3 practical exercises developed in Assembly language for the Computer Systems Organization course at Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (PUC-Campinas). Under the guidance of Professor Ricardo Pannain, these exercises provide a hands-on introduction to low-level programming for DOS environments, covering essential concepts from basic console interaction to more complex logic and arithmetic.

The purpose of this project is to document the initial steps in Assembly programming, illustrating fundamental techniques and problem-solving approaches in a resource-constrained environment.

Exercises Overview:
Each .ASM file corresponds to a specific exercise, progressively introducing new Assembly concepts:

> ATIV2_1.ASM: This program asks the user to type a lowercase letter. It then reads the character, converts it to the corresponding uppercase letter by subtracting the difference from the ASCII table ('a' - 'A'), and finally displays the result on the screen.

> ATIV2_2.ASM: This is a very simple program, similar to a "Hello, World!" program. Its sole function is to print the message "hello welcome" to the console and then terminate execution. The comments at the end of the file appear to be a record of register values during debugging.

> ATIV2_3.ASM: This Assembly language program works like a simple calculator; it asks the user to enter two single-digit numbers, converts them from characters to their numeric values so they can be added, and finally displays the result of the addition on the screen.

These exercises collectively provide an excellent foundation in Assembly programming for DOS, covering text display, data input, loops, conditionals, and basic arithmetic manipulation.
